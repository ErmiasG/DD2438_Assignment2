	abstract = {In Chapter 13 we saw how to plan a path for a robot from a given start position to a given goal position. The algorithm we gave always finds a path if it exists, but we made no claims about the quality of the path: it could make a large detour, or make lots of unnecessary turns. In practical situations we would prefer to find not just any path, but a good path.},
